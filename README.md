ABSTRACT:
      Nonverbal communication encompasses various methods of communication, including hand gestures or signs. Sign language is a collection of these hand gestures that enable communication, and it is commonly used by deaf-mute individuals to communicate with each other and others. However, it can be challenging for those who are not familiar with sign language to understand the gestures used.	
          As technology continues to advance, Gesture Recognition and Pattern Recognition have become popular fields of research. Hand gestures are an essential part of nonverbal communication and play a vital role in daily life.
 	To bridge the communication gap between deaf-mute individuals and others, we propose a project that involves creating a system for character classification in Indian Sign Language (ISL) or American Sign Language (ASL) using machine learning. This system aims to utilize the power of machine learning to accurately identify and classify different sign language characters, enabling better communication between deaf-mute individuals and the general population.

INTRODUCTION:
    Now a dayâ€™s sign language has much attention as the count of deaf and dumb was increasing over the years. Sign Language is the vision based natural language which is used for communication among people with low or no hearing sense and dumb that engages signs with the combination of hand movements, hand gestures. 
            Finally, our project aims to take the hand gestures as an input through webcam and to produce text to have an effective communication between the deaf and dumb people and normal people.

The signs of ASL are
